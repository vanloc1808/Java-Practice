# Java Practice
This is a repository for me to learn basic concepts of Java programming, especially OOP in Java.  
The main document that I use is the book "Object-Oriented Programming with Java" v5.1 of author Nguyen Minh Tuan, University of Science, VNUHCM.  
The folder "HCMUS - Topics in Java" contains my collected slides of subject "Topics in Java" (Java Application Programming) at HCMUS.
